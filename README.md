# Team_KT_geophysics_in_cloud

In this projects is the work presented by Chinaemerem Kanu and Tingting Zhang on the Geophysics in the Cloud - ML Competition 2021

Please visit the website for competition details: https://www.linkedin.com/events/geophysicsinthecloud-2021mlcomp6775841125908410368/

This competition require that teams (1-3 people) or individuals develop a novel machine learning seismic inversion algorithm to predict compressional impedance, shear impedance, and density. The big twist for the project is to execute the final solution on the AWS cloud! 

The main project python script is given in Testing_K_main.ipynb (Unfortunately the data is proprietary and is not available here). Also we add a notebook demonstration for loading seismic horizon into AWS.
